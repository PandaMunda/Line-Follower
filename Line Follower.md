# Line-Follower
It will Follow the path with the line it will even make turns accordingly it can be used for automation in restaurants.

The setup for this bot is very similar to the previous one that is why i will use the previous bot and schematics.

First of all get all the required parts:

You can get all the material for the above using the following links:

1 x Chassis --> https://a.co/d/2pmxRiq

2 x Dc Motor --> https://a.co/d/hThEPPq

2 x IR Sensor --> https://a.co/d/a8pLr5r

1 x L298 Motor Driver --> https://a.co/d/6bdZdHH

1 x Arduino Uno --> https://a.co/d/2X68hMl

1 x 12v rechargable battery --> https://a.co/d/3i5x2lS

As per need x Jumper wires --> https://a.co/d/9OpCN2D

On the chassis for the bot put all components for working something like this:

</p>

After that the connections can be done as shown in the schematics below:

Now for the coding part i will provide the code below for the functioning:

you can download the code using the given link and put it in your arduino:

Congratulations you have built your own obstacle avoider bot using arduino uno.

After attatching the battery mine was working completely fine as you can see in the video:

I had to push the bot because the DC motors i used had very less torque.

If you have any complications with the same you can try asking it in the queries section i will be there to help asap.
